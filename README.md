The **Pump.fun Solana Trading and Sniping Bot** is a sophisticated tool designed to automate trading and sniping of new token launches on the Solana blockchain.

## Trading Strategy

The bot’s trading strategy is carefully designed to ensure optimal performance in a dynamic market:

- **Profit Targets**:
  - Aims to take profit at a 25% increase, and again at another 25% increase.
  - Sells 50% of the tokens at the first 25% increase, and 75% of the remaining tokens at the next 25% increase.
- **Stop Loss**: The bot will sell all tokens if the market cap falls by 10%.
- **Bonding Curve**: Sells 75% of the tokens if the bonding curve reaches a critical level, keeping 25% as a moon bag.
